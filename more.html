    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p>
      I really do wish we could get rid of this &quot;service&quot; but <br>
      sadly, it&apos;s not something I can do. I know that a lot <br>
      of people have issues with this thing, but of course, <br>
      it&apos;s a program that a lot of schools use, and it&apos;s <br>
      gonna be one of those things that we have to deal with.

      Oh one more thing, if you actually think you could get around it, <br>
      here are the files the extension has. I doubt they are of much use, <br>
      considering they are just the ones from Chrome's extensions folder, <br>
      but hey! Maybe we will get lucky.

    <div style="padding-bottom:150px;"></div>
    <b>Note: </b>There are two extensions, Extension 1 seems to <br>
    be more for blocking websites on it's own at all times, while <br>
    the other one is mostly controlled by a teacher to do stuff <br>
    more direct. Targetting the first one would likely be better, <br>
    although the goal would be both.
