    <h1>More Info</h1>
    <pre>
I really do wish we could get rid of this &quot;service&quot; but 
sadly, it&apos;s not something I can do. I know that a lot 
of people have issues with this thing, but of course, 
it&apos;s a program that a lot of schools use, and it&apos;s 
gonna be one of those things that we have to deal with.
