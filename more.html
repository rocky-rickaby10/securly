    <h1>More Info</h1>
    <pre>
I really do wish we could get rid of this &quot;service&quot; but 
sadly, it&apos;s not something I can do. I know that a lot 
of people have issues with this thing, but of course, 
it&apos;s a program that a lot of schools use, and it&apos;s 
gonna be one of those things that we have to deal with.

Oh one more thing, if you actually think you could get around it, 
here are the files the extension has. I doubt they are of much use, 
considering they are just the ones from Chrome's extensions folder, 
but hey! Maybe we will get lucky.

	<button type="button" class="button" onclick="window.location.href = 'https://thatoneusercausingchaos.github.io/securly/uploads/Securly_Classroom_1.26.2_0.zip'">Download Extension 2</button><br>

<b>Note: </b>There are two extensions, Extension 1 seems to 
be more for blocking websites on it's own at all times, while 
the other one is mostly controlled by a teacher to do stuff 
more direct. Targetting the first one would likely be better, 
although the goal would be both.
